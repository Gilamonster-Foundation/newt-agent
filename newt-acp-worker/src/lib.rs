//! Newt-Agent ACP worker.
//!
//! Speaks the Agent Client Protocol (agentclientprotocol.com) over stdio so
//! `drake-foreman` can dispatch coding goals to Newt instances.
//!
//! Contract (per memory `feedback_drake_patch_not_prose` and
//! `feedback_empty_diff_is_a_crash`):
//! - Worker ONLY edits files; never `git add` / `git commit` / `git push`.
//! - Empty `git diff` post-turn is a deterministic crash — foreman counts it
//!   against the model's scorecard.
//! - `TaskReply.model_id` is mandatory.
